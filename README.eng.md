Gallows 2D.
The game, written in python, was created using the pygame library, as well as the sys module. (as well as the random library and the os module) 
Rules: Play with sound. 
This is my first graphic game, so do not judge strictly, there may be flaws in the project. 
The game is divided into levels, but the guaranteed difficulty will be only on the first three. The game has its own currency - social credits. Passing the levels, you will get it, losing the levels - you will lose.
The guessed letters will be highlighted in green, the unsuspected ones - in red. In the main menu on the left there will be a sound button - you can turn it off, but it is not desirable.
Also, saving works in this game - when closing, all user data is placed in a file that can be found in the same directory as the game itself. When you delete this file, when you start the game, all progress will be reset to zero.
